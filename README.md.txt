# 🧠 Python Objects and Data Structures Assessment

This project is a basic Python exercise focusing on variables, data types, and key data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. It was part of a technical assessment to demonstrate foundational Python knowledge.

---

## 📌 Description

The notebook contains code that demonstrates how to:
- Create and manipulate variables with string values
- Define, update, and reverse lists
- Add and remove elements from lists
- Work with tuples and sets
- Create and access dictionaries

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Key Concepts Covered

- **Strings** – declaration, concatenation
- **Lists** – indexing, appending, removing, reversing
- **Tuples** – understanding immutability
- **Sets** – handling unique values
- **Dictionaries** – storing and accessing key-value pairs
