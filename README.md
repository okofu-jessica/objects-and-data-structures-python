# 🧠 Python Objects and Data Structures Assessment

This project is a Python exercise that covers essential data structures and object handling. It was part of a basic assessment designed to test understanding of variables, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

## 📌 Description

The notebook walks through:
- Creating string variables
- Defining and modifying lists
- Working with tuples and sets
- Creating and accessing dictionary key-value pairs

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Key Concepts Covered

- Strings
- Lists
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries

## ▶️ How to Run

Clone this repository and open the notebook:

git clone https://github.com/okofu-jessica/objects-and-data-structures-python  
cd objects-and-data-structures-python  
jupyter notebook

## 🖼 Sample Code

my_list = [1, 2, 3]  
my_list.append(4)  
my_list.reverse()  
print(my_list)  # Output: [4, 3, 2, 1]

## 💡 What I Learned

- Differences between data structures
- Mutability vs immutability
- How to modify and access collections in Python

## ✅ Status

✔️ Completed – Ready to showcase
